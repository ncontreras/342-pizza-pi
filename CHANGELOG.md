Issues Resolved/Attempted:

Use a base price for size
Use a surcharge for deep dish
Different prices for meat toppings than vegetable toppings
Make at least 2 toppings "premium" and charge more
Display the price to the user each time the total is updated
Print the prices of each item next to its name (or display prices to the user in some fashion, at least)
	-An alert is displayed to the user when they select a size, crust or topping.
Write a function that calculates price. Call this function every time the pizza-updater class event is triggered
	-I couldn't finish the function. When a user selects a topping, crust, or size, the price gets reset to the price of the item selected.
Updating a topping updates the pizzaOrder object
	-toppingsMeat & toppingsMisc don't update correctly
pizzaOrder object is successfully saved to the localStorage
